Trying out weird combinations of features and 
this line break here and  
will eventually have to fix them.

sample para

*italic here*, **bold here**, `some code here`  
* this should not work* <space>
** neither should this* <space>
***italic bold here***
**will newling gives us weird behaviors
or will it**
we got a list, engarde:  
- *italic*  
- **bold**  
- *gotcha  
- and here too* asd  
- `just code`  
- *`just code`*  
- No `code here`  
- **`bold code`** yo dog what is this  
- [Wrong link Test Page 1](./2023/QSG_BREAK.md) 
- [Wrong link Test Page 1(123)  
trying bold  



```
*no this should not be bold or anything*
**this should just be treated normally**
normal
```
and `this is code inline` I dont know how to test this honestly, but you know,
it be what it be

trying paragraphs now. This is still part
of one singular sentence. Weird yes but it is still
formatted like a paragraph

trying another paragraph and this one should work fine.
And if it does then it works fine. That is just how it is you know.
It all be how it all be. Hiddy up

last paragraph I swear.

``` and now I am trying

to break this and this should just 
be shown like this *italic*, **bold**
```
testing an ordered list here:
1. testing 1
2. testing 2
3. testing 3
4. testing 4
and thats that


this needs to close though,
a check for the lack of a new line
